# Blackjack - by James Bellitto Mia Friedman and Katelyn Breen

The game of blacjack!  Run the code, and then respond to the  messages in the console to play an unlimimted number of hands vs the dealer.
Just like in casino blackjack, the dealer must hit with a hand of 16 or below and stay with a hand of 17 or above.

If we had more time, we would have liked to include a GUI, as well as add some other more intricate parts of the game, like splitting a hand,
where if you are dealt two cards of the same number, you play out two seperate hands and take the better result.  We could have also implemented 
betting, and other game mechanics to make it more like real casino blackjack.
