# Blackjack - by James Bellitto, Mia Friedman, and Katelyn Breen

The game of blackjack!  Run the code, and then respond to the  messages in the console to play an unlimited number of hands vs the dealer. The goal is to get a hand that adds up to as close as possible to 21 without going over 21. You start with 2 cards, and can tell the dealer to hit or stay. You can continue to hit only until you bust (have a hand that adds up to more than 21). If you hit, the dealer will add another card to your hand. If you stay, you keep your hand as it is, and then the dealer takes their turn.
The dealer's turn is automated to follow certain rules, just like in casino Blackjack. It must hit with a hand of 16 or below and stay with a hand of 17 or above. If neither the dealer nor the player busts, whoever has a total closer to 21 wins. 

If we had more time, we would have liked to include a GUI, as well as add some other more intricate parts of the game, like splitting a hand, where if you are dealt two cards of the same number, you play out two seperate hands and take the better result.  We could also implement betting, and other game mechanics to make it more like real casino Blackjack.
